# Ruby Diner

Simple diner program run in the terminal. Goal was to implement a set of menus using nested hashes. It should include entry validations. 

## To Run:

Run the application.rb file from the terminal:

```
ruby application.rb
```

Laugh. Maybe. ^_^

## TODO:
[ ] Refactor Validations
[ ] Rebuild the program using class hierarchy
[ ] Refactor duplicate sleep and formatting code
